**BlobShader.shader**

Shader that moves a mesh kind of like a jelly fish.

**Icosahedron.cs**

Unity script to procedurally generate an icosahedron. 

**InfiniteVirtualGrid.cs**
 
Contains a class to make a 2D spatial partioning grid with an extra level of indirection.
This makes it essentially extend infinitely in each direction.
This also wastes less memory, because grid cells are not directly backed by an array any more.
